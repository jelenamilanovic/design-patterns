// The idea which lies beyond Singleton pattern is to create only one instance of some class.
// So, the first call of the constructor will create a new instance and the others will just return created object.

// In JS, Singleton pattern is every object that is not instantiated from the class.
// There are, however, some alternatives to create a Singleton.
